# spamalot slave (wip)

## description
The spamalot-slave is a SPA acting on behalf of the spamalot coordinator.

The goal of spamalot is to leverage unused power to increase
the IOTA Tangle's overall throughput by spamming the network
with transactions after a best effort approach.

## todo

This project is pretty much in its infancy, basically everything
has to be done.
